## 📋 When You Receive an Offer

### Step 1: Evaluate (Within 24 Hours)

**Good Offer** (Accept or Counter):
- $4,000-4,500: Accept immediately!
- $3,500-3,999: Counter at $4,000 or accept if they seem serious
- $3,000-3,499: Counter at $3,700, minimum accept $3,500

**Low Offer** (Politely Decline):
- Below $3,000: "Thank you, but my minimum is $3,500. However, I can include extra bonuses at $3,800..."

### Step 2: Communicate

Response template:
```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for your offer of $[amount]!

[If accepting]:
Great! I accept your offer. Let's proceed with Flippa escrow. 
I'll include [bonuses] as a thank you for a smooth transaction.

[If countering]:
I appreciate your interest! My minimum for this project is $[counter].
At this price, I'll include [bonuses]. Does that work for you?

I'm available for a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,
Marif
bergan.marif@gmail.com
```

### Step 3: Use Flippa Escrow

1. Buyer pays Flippa
2. Flippa holds money in escrow
3. You transfer code + documentation
4. Buyer verifies (5-7 days)
5. Buyer approves release
6. Flippa releases payment to you (minus 10% fee)

**Flippa Fee**: 10% of sale price (e.g., $450 if sold at $4,500)

## 🚨 Red Flags (Scam Warnings)

**Be careful if buyer**:
- Asks to transact outside Flippa escrow
- Wants to pay with cryptocurrency only
- Asks for code before payment
- Pressures you to "act now"
- Offers way above asking price (too good to be true)
- Asks for your personal financial info

**Always use**:
- Flippa escrow OR
- Escrow.com (for large transactions)

**Never**:
- Share code before payment clears

- Accept payment via Western Union, gift cards, etc.
